### Chapter 2: Easy Does It: Why Trying Too Hard Can Sometimes Be Part of the Problem

* Prime Your Mental Pump
  * It helps to take a "picture walk" through the chapter as you first begin looking at a chapter or section of a book that teaches concepts of math or science
  * Glance not only at the graphics, diagrams, and photos, but also at section headings, summary, and even questions at the end of the chapter

* Focused Mode
  * Focused mode thinking involves a direct approach to solving problems using rational, sequential, analytical approaches
  * The focused mode is associated with the concentrating abilities of the brain's prefrontal cortex, located right behind your forehead
 
* Diffuse Mode
  * Diffuse mode allows us to suddenly gain a new insight on a problem we've been struggling with and is associated with "big-picture" prespectives
  * Diffuse mode thinking is what happens when you relax your attention and just let your mind wander, this relaxation can allow different areas of the brain to hook up and return valuable insights
  * Diffuse mode is less affiliated with any one area of the brain
