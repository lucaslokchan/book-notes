## A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)
By Barbara Oakley

### Chapter 1: Open the Door

### Chapter 2: Easy Does It: Why Trying Too Hard Can Sometimes Be Part of the Problem

#### Prime Your Mental Pump
* It helps to take a "picture walk" through the chapter as you first begin looking at a chapter or section of a book that teaches concepts of math or science
* Glance not only at the graphics, diagrams, and photos, but also at section headings, summary, and even questions at the end of the chapter

#### Focused Mode - A Tight Pinball Machine
* Focused mode thinking involves a direct approach to solving problems using rational, sequential, analytical approaches
* The focused mode is associated with the concentrating abilities of the brain's prefrontal cortex, located right behind your forehead
* The focused mode is used to concentrate on something that's already tightly connected in your mind, often because you are familiar and comfortable with the underlying concepts
* In focused mode, sometimes you inadvertenly find yourself focusing intently and trying to slove a problem using erroneous thoughts that are in a different place in the brain from the "solution thoughts you need to actually slove the problem
 
#### Diffuse Mode - A Spread-Out Pinball Machine
* Diffuse mode allows us to suddenly gain a new insight on a problem we've been struggling with and is associated with "big-picture" prespectives
* Diffuse mode thinking is what happens when you relax your attention and just let your mind wander, this relaxation can allow different areas of the brain to hook up and return valuable insights
* Diffuse mode is less affiliated with any one area of the brain
* Diffuse mode is useful when you are learning something new, it doesn't allow you to focus tightly and intently to slove a specific problem; It can allow you to get closer to    where that solution lies because you are able to trabel much farther before running into another bumper
* The connections are further apart

#### Focused Vs Diffuse Mode
* You can have a concentrated beam of light that only illuminates a small area very brightly or you can have a less concentrated beam that illuminates a much broader area with a dimmer light

Pinball Machine Analogy of Focused Mode and Diffuse Mode

#### Why Math and Science Can Be More Challenging?
* Abstractness and encryptedness adds levels of complexity; they can make the pinball bumpers a bit spongier
* Einstellung effect - An idea you already have in mind, or your simple initial thought prevents a better idea or solution from being found
* Think of Einstellung as installing a roadblock because of the way you are initially looking at something
* One significant mistake students make in learning math and science is jumping into the water before they learn to swim

#### Why Are There Two Modes of Thinking?
*  Vertebrates have to stay alive and pass their genes on to their offspring
*  e.g A bird needs to focus tiny pieces of grain as it pecks the ground for food and scan the horizon for predators at the same time
*  In humans, we see a similar splitting of brain functions
 * The left side of the brain is associated with careful, focused attention, more specialized for handling sequential information and logical thinking
 * The right side is more tied to diffuse scanning of the environment and interacting with other people, more associated with emotions
* To learn about and be creative in math and science, we need to strengthen and use both the focused and diffuse modes
 * One mode will process the information it receives and then send the result back to the other mode
