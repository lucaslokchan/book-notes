By Shu Hattori

### Chapter 1: Building the Better Self

#### Principle 1 - Focus on What Really Matters

* McKinsey's problem sloving steps
  * Identifying the problem
  * Structuring the problem using a MECE approach
  * Prioritizing and eliminating unnecessary problems
  * Creating the analysis and work plan
  * Conducting the analysis
  * Synthesizing to derive meaningful results
  * Delivering the right communication message 
* Distinguish what matter the most to the problem
  * E.g., Focus on creating the core service of you business instead of dwelling on insignificant things (E.g, Company name, logo)
* "I will start on this when the business gets rolling" -> "Can I do it now? why not?"
* Focus and prioritization
  * Use sense of urgency and deadline
  * Follow the critical path
  * Link it to the money
 

#### Principle 2 - Start with the Hard Stuff in the Morning

* Work on the painful tasks in the morning to deliver productive output

#### Principle 3 - Catch Small Signals and Make a Difference

* Apply the 80-20 analysis
* Focus on being distinctive
* Be sensitive to small signals

#### Principle 4 - Have a 30-Second Answer to Everything

* Short answers are important to impress someone fast
* Form an answer beforehand
* Double-clicking
  * E.g., A short summary of a book tells you enough to get you interested but not for you to know what's happening, so you end up finding out more 
  * A 30-second answer let your listener keep refocusing to the topic of his/her interest
* Take apart the main question; C-level executive: "How is the project coming along" can be divided into
   1. What is the overall project status
   2. What are the examples that support the status
   3. What do I plan to do about any problems
   4. What can the C-level executive do to help
 * Think of an answer like a dartboard; from the outermost ring to the center
 * Reasons to practice the 30-second answer
   * Develop a sense of what people want
   * To practive synthesis skills
   * Become a better presenter
   * Subconsciously train mind to reach the CEO level
 
#### Principle 5 - Frontload your Project

 * Shine in the first week because that is when most of the impression about you will be decided
   * Shows how quickly you can learn your job, apply what you've learned and take command of your lifestyle
 * Get senior leaders to spend as much time as possible with you
   * Have to chance to shaple the outcome, project setup beforehand
   * You will be looked upon as a highly reliable person with a fast learning curve
 * Complete your end story line up front
   * Create a timeline, work plan with category breakdown
 * Get all burning questions answered
   *  Ask questions upfront in the first week - "risk free" asking period
   *  Use casual settings to ask sensitive questions, refrain from asking in writing
   *  Develop a sense of priority in deciding which questions to ask
   *  Rserve fact-based questions in lower priority  
  * Discover the learning and motivation on team members
  * Organize all necessary meetings in the first week
  * Delegate work you don't need to handle yourself
 
 #### Principle 6 - Create the Right End Output Image
  
  * Put together an end of project output impage as soon as possible
   * Present a case with the ending already factored in
  * Have an end output visionary
  * Top down vision: end product; answer in advance

#### Principle 7 - Smile When You are Under Stress

 * When we see others in a positive state, we tend to emulate them
 * Have a different frame of mind
   * What is the big picture?
   * Are we trying to slove the same issue just from different angles?
   * Can i separate the problem from the person?
   * What is the root cause of the hostility?
 * Keeping a smile enables you to not lose your temper and think logically, ahead of the other person
 * By keeping a positive outward presence, you can keep the discussion going
 * You tend to nod your head more when you smile, the other person senses acknowledgement and return less anger

#### Principle 8 - Go Beyond Your Self Perceived Limit

 * Growth is not glamorous but painful
 * Developing a new capacity to handle things requires patience and action; Take incremental steps
 * If you are going to complain, blame or criticize, do something about it
 * Share your pain points with others, reaching out will allow you to think outside the box
 * Stop thinking about past failures and future uncertainties
   * Always turn to the next problem and solution

#### Principle 9 - Always Imagine the Worst Case Scenario

 * Imaging the worst-case scenario will enable you to make decisions more quickly and think about the next-step actions
   * Allows you to cover more ground
   * Anxieties fall as you participate in the anticipation
   * Know whom to talk and what steps are going to be effective
 * Countermeasure-drive instead of firefighting
 * Have ready-made countermeasures in place, best done at the beginning of the project and right before the final/import milestone
 * Play not to lose and keep calm

#### Principle 10 - Start Following Up

 * Following up can avoid missing import opportunities and major losses
 * Shows presence, awareness and solid reputation; build credibility fast
 * Reread notes
 * Our memory is not reliable as it tends to distort reality due to stress, passage of time etc. Take notes and free your mind from problem sloving
 * Summarize meetings, discussions into a few core themes
 * Ask clients out on meals even after the project is finished

#### Principle 11 - Push Back With Less Emotion

 * 24-hour rule: When someone gives you something outrageous to do, wait for 24 hours before you act upon it with a counteroffer
   * Think logically rather than emotionally
 * When you are assigned to a new task, ask "What is the objective" and "Why are we doing this"
