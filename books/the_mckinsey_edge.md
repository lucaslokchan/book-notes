* Distinguish what matter the most to the problem

  * A 30-second answer let your listener keep refocusing to the topic of his/her interest
* Take apart the main question; C-level executive: "How is the project coming along" can be divided into
   1. What is the overall project status
   2. What are the examples that support the status
   3. What do I plan to do about any problems
   4. What can the C-level executive do to help
 * Think of an answer like a dartboard; from the outermost ring to the center
 * Reasons to practice the 30-second answer
   * Develop a sense of what people want
   * To practive synthesis skills
   * Become a better presenter
   * Subconsciously train mind to reach the CEO level

   * Shows how quickly you can learn your job, apply what you've learned and take command of your lifestyle
 * Get senior leaders to spend as much time as possible with you

   * You will be looked upon as a highly reliable person with a fast learning curve
 * Complete your end story line up front

 * Get all burning questions answered
   *  Ask questions upfront in the first week - "risk free" asking period
   *  Use casual settings to ask sensitive questions, refrain from asking in writing

   *  Rserve fact-based questions in lower priority  
  * Discover the learning and motivation on team members
